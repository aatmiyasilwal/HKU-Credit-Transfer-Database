# HKU Credit Transfer Database

### Overview
---
This project is designed to streamline the process for outgoing exchange students from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) by providing a unified querying system for credit transfer data. Using Selenium, multiple scrapers have been developed to gather course-related information from various publicly available HKU resources. The data is then consolidated into a consistent format in CSV files, enabling students to easily access and query the information they need. Currently, the database contains equivalence information on 25,000+ courses from 150+ universities.

**Live Demo**: [HKU Credit Transfer Database](https://credit-transfer-database.netlify.app/)

### Getting Started
---
#### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
* Python 3.x (currently using Python 3.12.8)
* Selenium
* PyPDF2
* Camelot
* Pandas
* time
* A compatible web driver (e.g., Safari, Chrome) â€” (I used Safari)

### Installation
---
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hku-credit-transfer-scraper.git
   cd hku-credit-transfer-scraper
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the appropriate web driver installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

### Usage
---
1. Run the scrapers to collect data.
2. The scraped data will be saved in CSV format in the `backend/` directory, and eventually compiled in the `merged-credit_transfer_database.csv`.
3. To launch the website locally, use:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server <port number>
   ```

### Future Plans
---
1. Improve the user interface, which is currently barebones.
2. Incorporating the Law faculty database
